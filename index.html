          <p>
            My name is Brad Kelley. I have over 25-years of experience as a
            technology consultant and recently endeavored to become a full-stack
            software developer. In 2002, I co-founded Mercury Associates, Inc.
            (“Mercury”), the largest independent fleet consulting and technology
            services firm in North America. I served as the firm’s Senior Vice
            President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for 20-years until the
            company was purchased by CDPQ, a leading global private equity
            platform. As the firms CTO, I led the firm's Technology Consulting
            Services & Cloud Services business lines, which provided advisory
            and technical services as well as SaaS and IaaS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I departed Mercury to pursue a long-time dream of becoming
            a software developer, creating native web applications with
            intuitive, visually stunning interfaces. I am particularly
            passionate about solutions that harmonize and visualize complex
            business activities in a “single pane of glass” – unifying diverse
            data streams and technologies, such as business systems, IoT and
            geospatial data, artificial intelligence, and analytics.
            Additionally, I am highly interested in skeuomorphic and neumorphic
            UI designs to improve software usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently pursuing a full-stack developer certification with
            Rice University, which should be awarded by April 2022. I also hold
            a master's in public administration (MPA) with Southern Illinois
            University and a bachelor's (BS) in international business with
            Spring Hill College.
          </p>
          <p>
            My wife, Bobi, and I have two adult children, four grandchildren,
            and five dogs. We also raise honey bees on our farm in New Waverly,
            Texas.

            <h2>Chit Chat</h2>
            <p>
              Chit Chat is a mobile-responsive, social media platform on which
              users can post messages and pictures - known as "Shout Outs".
              Anyone can view Shout Outs, including unregistered users, but only
              registered users can create, update, and delete them.
              Additionally, registered users can add comments & rate content
              shared by others. Chit Chat is my second multi-developer project
              and employs MVC design, as well as leverages MySQL, RESTful APIs,
              and user session management with cookies.

            <h2>LocalBeats</h2>
            <p>
              LocalBeats is a mobile-responsive, web application designed to
              provide its users with music videos and live events. Users simply
              select a music genre and enter a city name and the application
              presents content from YouTube (videos) and events from
              Ticketmaster; which is dynamically populated using multiple
              RESTful APIs. Jquery, HTML5, Bulma, and P5 were also used in the
              development of the program. Additionally, LocalBeats is my first
              multi-developer project, requiring both synthesis of ideas and
              code - a fantastic experience at all levels.

            <h2>Horiseon</h2>
            <p>
              Horiseon is a class project in which I modified an existing code
              set to address various bugs, incorporate accessibility features,
              and improve CSS styling format. Some of the improvements made
              included consolidation of CSS classes, adding meta tags for
              accessibility and search engine optimization, and curing
              incomplete code syntax.

            <h2>Run Buddy</h2>
            <p>
              Run Buddy is a site that I created as part of my full-stack
              developer training. A core feature is its ability to dynamically
              scale fonts and images, as well as placement of site content at
              different screen resolutions a necessity with the ubiquitous use
              and diversity of mobile devices. Responsiveness of site elements
              is controlled by CSS styling properties, such as flex and media
              queries.
