​
## [Description](#description)
My name is Brad Kelley. I have over 25-years of experience as a technology consultant and recently endeavored to become a full-stack software developer. Enclosed is my development portfolio, which I am continually updating with my latest projects. The app powering my portfolio uses React, a leading component-based UI package created by Facebook. The narrative below describes the technical elements of the app.
